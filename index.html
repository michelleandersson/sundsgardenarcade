            <h2>The Why</h2>
            <p>Each year, the participants in Sundgården Folkhögskola's IT courses finish off the course
                by creating a game from scratch in React. Unfortunately, since these games only live in the
                participants' local repositories, no one ever gets to play these games. We want to change that!
            </p>
            <p>Now all the participants who want to may choose to show off their game on this website! Below you
                will find the games made by the different groups of participants throughout different years of
                studies at Sundsgården Folkhögskola.
